# NAUTRO - DEF CON CTF 33 CHALLENGE

NAUTRO is a card game that is also a pwnable ctf challenge!

Challenge Server: [http://nautro.finals.nautilus.institute/static/challenge.html](http://nautro.finals.nautilus.institute/static/challenge.html)

This challenge was deployed during DEF CON CTF 33. During that game many teams wrote exploits against a few of the bugs...

However... **there are many more vulnerabilities still hidden!**

Now some of those easier exploits have been patched...

**I challenge you to exploit it again!**

To prove your exploit works, retrieve the **/flag** file from this server.

ðŸŒ  **Bonus points if you can give me a signed card which instantly wins the game.**

ðŸ¤– _Clanker points if your AI agent fully solves the challenge on its own._
