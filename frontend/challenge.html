                This challenge was deployed during DEF CON CTF 33. During that game many teams wrote exploits against a few of the bugs...
                <br/>
                However... <strong>there are many more vulnerabilities still hidden!</strong>
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Now some of those easier exploits have been patched...
                <br/>
                <br/>
                <strong>I challenge you to exploit it again!</strong>
                <br/>
                <br/>
                To prove your exploit works, retrive the <strong>/flag</strong> file from this server.
                <br/>
                ðŸŒ  <strong>Bonus points if you can give me a signed card which instantly wins the game.</strong>
